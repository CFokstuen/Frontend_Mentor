# Frontend Mentor Projects

This repository contains my solutions to various coding challenges from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/). Each project is organized into its own directory.

## 1). Recipe Page

The challenge was to build a recipe page and get it as close to the design as possible. <br> 
This was completed by using HTML5 and CSS3 only.
